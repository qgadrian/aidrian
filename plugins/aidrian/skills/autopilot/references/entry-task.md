# Entry: a task

Read at the start of a run launched with a `<task>`. Phase 1 below takes it to committed work on the task branch;
`references/phases.md` § 2 to § 4 follow.
Read `references/phases.md` before the engine starts: its § 2 runs inside the engine's last phase.

## The task

`<task>` is an issue key or URL, a plan path, or a one-line task description.
Missing or unclear: ask now, while the Human is here. Never guess the task.

Before launch, while the Human is here:

- A vague or large task: run the `challenge` skill first, or the `plan-review` skill on an existing plan.
- Best: launch from the task worktree, so the run never has to ask about one.

## 1. Implement

Pick the engine by the input:

| Input | Engine |
| --- | --- |
| An issue key or URL | the `issue-implement` skill on the issue |
| A plan path whose frontmatter has `issue_id` or `issue_ref` | the `issue-implement` skill on that issue |
| Any other plan path | the `plan-implement` skill on the plan |
| A one-line task | `planning-agent` writes a plan, then the `plan-implement` skill runs it |

- **A one-line task.** Dispatch `planning-agent` in the foreground with the task, the Human's launch words,
  and the path `<state>/plans/<slug>-plan.md`, where `<state>` is the folder `aidrian state` prints
  and `<slug>` is the task in a few lowercase words joined by `-`.
  A plan that comes back `open-questions` or `blocked` leaves nothing to implement: park its questions and stop.
- **An issue-anchored plan.** `plan-implement` stops on one, so read the plan's frontmatter before picking the engine.
  Run `issue-implement` on its `issue_id`, else its `issue_ref`. That skill's phase 0 reads the plan only at
  `<state>/plans/<key>-implementation.md` (the `planning-agent` skill's `references/plan-file.md`):
  a plan at another path is not the one it would run, so stop.
- **Workspace.** The current checkout when it is a task worktree on the task's branch; otherwise the engine creates one
  through the `orchestration` skill § 1. The launch approves a new branch, so the `worktree-new` skill's question is answered
  for `branch_mode: new`. Its question about reusing an existing branch, and the question about changes in the main checkout,
  are not: stop, since no work can start without a workspace.
- The engine's slice plan, per-slice review, verification, and one commit per slice all hold.
  A "stop and ask" inside it becomes park and go on; when it leaves no independent slice, the engine stops and so does the run.
