# Claude Code

How the plugin installs and runs in Claude Code.
The install commands are in the [README](../../README.md#claude-code).

## Install

- Claude Code clones the plugin's short name over SSH.
- Inside a session, type the same commands after `/plugin`, such as `/plugin install aidrian@aidrian-harness`.
- Agents appear as `aidrian:<agent>`, and skills as `/aidrian:<skill>`.
- To offer the plugin to everyone who opens a project, commit `.claude/settings.json`,
  as in the [example project](../../examples/consumer/.claude/settings.json).

## Update

```sh
claude plugin marketplace update aidrian-harness
claude plugin update aidrian@aidrian-harness
```

## From a local checkout

To try a branch before it merges, add a checkout of this repository as the marketplace, then install as usual:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/aidrian-harness
```

Claude Code caches the plugin by version.
A change arrives only after `npm run bump` in the checkout, then the two [update](#update) commands.
Set the version back before you commit: a pull request never changes it ([Versions](../contributing.md#versions)).

## Running aidrian

`aidrian` and `aidrian-knowledge` are on the PATH inside a Claude Code session.
In a terminal or a git hook, run them from the plugin folder, `~/.claude/plugins/cache/aidrian-harness/aidrian/<version>`.
When `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set, that folder is under it instead of `~/.claude`.

Claude Code keeps the old version folder after an update, so ask it for the current one.
This puts both commands on the PATH of the current shell:

```sh
plugin=$(claude plugin list --json |
  node -p 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0)).find((p) => p.id === "aidrian@aidrian-harness").installPath')
export PATH="$plugin/bin:$PATH"
```

## Hooks

Claude Code runs every hook in [`hooks.json`](../../plugins/aidrian/hooks/hooks.json) once the plugin is enabled.
There is nothing to trust or turn on.
[hooks.md](../hooks.md) lists each hook; the ones marked Claude Code run only here.
The [host adapter](../../plugins/aidrian/lib/hosts/claude-code.mjs) holds what the shared code reads from this host:
its payloads need no mapping, since their names are the standard, but for [a GitHub MCP server from a plugin](#a-github-mcp-server-from-a-plugin).
[Where the tracker guard is verified](../hooks.md#where-the-tracker-guard-is-verified) has the evidence.

Claude Code cancels a SessionEnd hook that runs longer than a short budget as it exits, and reports `Hook cancelled`.
The session-end hook deletes the session's temporary files itself, and hands the [`session` row](../dispatch-log.md#session-when-a-session-ends)
to a detached worker, so a long session's transcripts never hold up the exit.
For a session holding a [tracker refusal marker](../config.md#how-a-write-is-judged), it also writes one `hook_deny` row in process.
That row reads no transcript and waits on no lock, so the hook stays within its budget.

## A GitHub MCP server from a plugin

Claude Code names a tool of an MCP server a plugin bundles `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>`
([its hooks reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)), so the GitHub MCP server installed through the `github`
plugin merges through `mcp__plugin_github_github__merge_pull_request`.
The adapter reads such a call as `mcp__github__<tool>`, the name the [merge guard](../hooks.md#merge-guard),
the [ready hold](../hooks.md#ready-hold), and the [review gate](../config.md#review-gate) read, when both hold:

- The tool is one of those the GitHub MCP hook judges: `merge_pull_request`, `update_pull_request`,
  `update_pull_request_draft_state`, `add_issue_comment`, `add_reply_to_pull_request_comment`, and `pull_request_review_write`.
- One word of the plugin and server names, words split at `_`, holds `github` in any case, such as `github_github`,
  `acme-tools_GitHub`, or `github-enterprise_gh`.

The tool name alone is not enough: other forges' MCP servers, such as Gitea's and Bitbucket's, have a `merge_pull_request`
or an `update_pull_request` of their own, and the merge guard refuses a merge whose head it cannot read.
So a GitHub MCP server under a plugin or server name that holds no `github` is not read, and its calls run unchecked.
The hook's payload keeps the name Claude Code sent as `raw_tool_name`, so a pattern a project wrote in that form still matches.
A second `PreToolUse` group in `hooks.json`, last so that no other group's place moves, runs the GitHub MCP hook on these
names, with the adapter's pattern, anchored and with no lookaround so that Codex reads it as well;
`test/host-plugin-github.test.mjs` holds the two equal. Verified with the GitHub MCP server's documented input through the
real hook, not with a live plugin install.

## Models and effort

A hook adds the project's `models.claude` choice to each Agent tool call, from the next call on.
[config.md](../config.md#models) has the keys.

- An `effort` choice needs Claude Code 2.1.292 or later, the first version whose Agent tool call takes `effort`.
- The Agent tool takes only the four `claude` model names in config.md, never a full model id or `inherit`.
- A model or effort the dispatching agent passes for one call still wins.
- Another hook in the project that rewrites Agent calls may override the choice.
  Claude Code runs matching hooks in parallel, and each rewrite replaces the whole call.
- A session started with `claude --agent <name>` keeps the agent file's values.
  Start it with `--model` and `--effort` to choose others.

## Agent gates

The [agent gates](../hooks.md#agent-gates) learn who is calling from the hook input.
Checked on Claude Code 2.1.314, with a hook that logged each call:

- A subagent's call carries `agent_type` and `agent_id`.
  `agent_type` is `aidrian:<agent>` for this plugin's agents, and the agent's own name for a project agent.
- The main session's call carries neither, so it is `main`.
- A session started with `claude --agent <name>` carries `agent_type` alone, so it is both `main` and that agent.

So Claude Code holds each agent to its gates, tool by tool and pattern by pattern.

## Limits

Claude Code enforces each agent's tool limits.
A read-only agent cannot use `Write`, `Edit`, or `NotebookEdit`: [Merge order](../agent-sources.md#merge-order).
